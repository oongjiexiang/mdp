** Ensure that your compiler has "ws32.lib"(VS) or "libws2_32.a"(codeblocks) in your libraries/dependencies or the code will not work.
To test the code, change the ip address to your own ip address if testing on the dummy server. Port number can be left as 17(QOTD) as long as it is the same for both the client and server.
Do not submit test server, it is just code I copy and pasted to create a dummy server on my pc used for testing the client side function purposes only. The actual server is created by the RPI team.
